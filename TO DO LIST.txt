Based on the codebase analysis, here's the implementation of proficiency levels in the system:
Framework Support:
The system supports multiple language proficiency frameworks:
CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference)
ACTFL (American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages)
JLPT (Japanese Language Proficiency Test)
HSK (Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi - Chinese)
TOPIK (Test of Proficiency in Korean)
Level Structure:
Each framework has its own set of levels:
CEFR:
A1 (Beginner)
A2 (Elementary)
B1 (Intermediate)
B2 (Upper Intermediate)
C1 (Advanced)
C2 (Mastery)
ACTFL:
Novice Low
Novice Mid
Novice High
Intermediate Low
Intermediate Mid
Intermediate High
Advanced Low
Advanced Mid
Advanced High
Superior
JLPT:
N5 (Basic)
N4 (Elementary)
N3 (Intermediate)
N2 (Pre-Advanced)
N1 (Advanced)
HSK:
HSK 1 (Basic)
HSK 2 (Elementary)
HSK 3 (Intermediate)
HSK 4 (Upper Intermediate)
HSK 5 (Advanced)
HSK 6 (Mastery)
TOPIK:
TOPIK 1 (Beginner)
TOPIK 2 (Elementary)
TOPIK 3 (Intermediate)
TOPIK 4 (Upper Intermediate)
TOPIK 5 (Advanced)
TOPIK 6 (Mastery)
Implementation Details:
The framework and level are stored in both the course and modules tables
Each course has a framework setting that determines which level system to use
Modules within a course must use the same framework as the course
The system includes level equivalency mappings between different frameworks
The UI provides a framework selector and corresponding level selector based on the chosen framework
Database Structure:
Apply
UI Implementation:
Framework selection is available when creating/editing courses
Level selection is available for both courses and modules
The level selector dynamically updates based on the selected framework
The UI shows the framework and level in a formatted way (e.g., "CEFR A1" or "JLPT N5")
Level Equivalency:
The system includes mappings between equivalent levels across different frameworks. For example:
JLPT N5 ≈ CEFR A1 ≈ ACTFL Novice Low/Mid ≈ HSK 1 ≈ TOPIK 1
JLPT N1 ≈ CEFR C1/C2 ≈ ACTFL Advanced High/Superior ≈ HSK 5/6 ≈ TOPIK 5/6
This implementation allows for:
Flexible course creation with different proficiency frameworks
Consistent level tracking across the platform
Easy comparison between different language proficiency standards
Clear progression paths for students
Framework-specific content organization
Would you like me to provide more details about any specific aspect of this implementation?

I've made the following fixes:
In the module edit page:
Added frameworkMappings to the imports
Replaced the hardcoded framework options with dynamic options from frameworkMappings
In the new course page:
Added frameworkMappings to the imports
Fixed the framework selection to use frameworkMappings instead of getFrameworkInfo
These changes ensure that:
All pages use the same source of truth for framework options
The framework selection is consistent across the application
Any updates to the framework mappings will be reflected everywhere
The type safety is maintained throughout the application
The error you were seeing (TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')) was likely occurring because:
The framework value in the form data wasn't properly typed as Framework
The framework selection wasn't using the proper source of truth (frameworkMappings)
Now all pages use the same pattern:
Import frameworkMappings from framework-utils
Use Object.entries(frameworkMappings) to generate the framework options
Use getFrameworkLevels to get the levels for the selected framework
Use getFrameworkInfo to get the framework description
Would you like me to make any additional changes or explain any part of the fix in more detail?

I understand. Yes, that's a good point for future enhancement. Currently, the discount logic is hardcoded with:
Starting discount rate: 5%
Discount increment: 2.5%
Increment period: Every 4 weeks
Maximum discount cap: 50%
In the future, we could make this configurable by:
Adding new fields to the institution or course model in the Prisma schema:
Apply
Creating an institution settings page where administrators can configure these values
Modifying the WeeklyPricingTable component to use these configurable values instead of hardcoded ones
For now, we'll keep the current implementation as is, and this can be added to the roadmap for future development. Would you like to proceed with testing the current weekly pricing implementation?

course_weekly_prices table:
Stores the actual weekly prices for each course
Contains: courseId, weekNumber, year, price
Used for the progressive discount pricing model we just implemented
This is what we're currently using and saving to
course_pricing_rules table:
Designed for time-based pricing rules (e.g., seasonal pricing, special offers)
Contains: courseId, startDate, endDate, price
Could be used for things like:
Summer course discounts
Early bird pricing
Holiday specials
Peak/off-peak pricing
The course_pricing_rules table is currently empty because we haven't implemented the time-based pricing feature yet. This could be a future enhancement where institutions can set special pricing for specific date ranges.
Would you like to:
Continue testing the weekly pricing functionality?
Implement the time-based pricing rules feature?
Or focus on something else?

The changes I've made ensure that:
"Reset to Calculated Prices":
Uses calculateWeeklyPrice to apply progressive discounts
Updates both price and baseTotal correctly
Maintains the discount percentage display
"Generate Prices":
Regenerates prices for next 12 weeks from today
Uses the same progressive discount formula
Updates all date fields
"Reset to Default Prices":
Sets prices to basePrice * weekNumber (no discounts)
Sets discount to 0%
Maintains correct baseTotal calculation
"Edit All":
Toggles the isTableEditable state
Enables/disables the Final Price input fields
Doesn't affect other columns
The price calculation formula is now consistent across all functions:
Base Total = basePrice * weekNumber
Discount = min(5 + (weekNumber-1)/4 * 2.5, 50)%
Final Price = Base Total * (1 - discount/100)
Each button should now work as intended:
"Reset to Calculated Prices" - applies progressive discounts
"Generate Prices" - refreshes dates and prices
"Reset to Default Prices" - removes all discounts
"Edit All" - enables manual price editing

Add infinite scrolling, lazy loading of images, optimise asset sizes, show skeletons and implement progressive loading. Implement for courses first and if successfull then we may consider implementing the optimasation throughout the project

Based on the code, here's what records are available to students through their dashboard:
Enrollment Details (CourseAccessStatus component):
Course title and institution name
Enrollment status (ACTIVE, PENDING_PAYMENT, etc.)
Payment status (PENDING, PAID)
Start and end dates
Payment amount and invoice number
Option to complete payment if pending
Payment History (StudentPaymentsPage):
Institution name
Payment amount and currency
Payment method used
Payment date
Reference number (if available)
Payment status
Course Progress (from StudentCourseEnrollment model):
Progress percentage
Course status
Start and end dates
Payment status and date
Payment Details (from Payment model):
Amount paid
Payment status
Payment method
Payment date
Reference number
Any additional metadata (like invoice number)
The student dashboard provides a comprehensive view of:
Their current enrollments and their status
Payment history and details
Course progress and access status
Payment requirements and options
All of this information is presented in a user-friendly interface with:
Status badges for quick visual reference
Clear payment requirements and options
Detailed payment history
Course access status and progress tracking
The data is fetched securely using the student's session ID to ensure they only see their own records.


Add the payment button to a specific page in your dashboard?
Implement a specific payment gateway integration?
Add any additional features to the payment system?

Add any additional features to the PaymentStatus component?
Add more payment status types?

Would you like me to:
Create the Payment model in the Prisma schema?
Add the relationship between Student and Payment models?
