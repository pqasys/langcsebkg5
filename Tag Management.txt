I'll outline the complete workflow of the tagging system based on the codebase:
Tag Management Interface (/admin/tags):
Admin users can access the tag management page through the admin sidebar
The page displays a list of all tags with their usage counts

Features:
Create new tags
Edit existing tags
Delete tags
View how many courses are using each tag

Tag Creation:
Admin clicks "Add Tag" button
Modal opens with a form containing:
Tag name (required)
Tag description (optional)
On submit:
Validates the input
Makes POST request to /api/tags
Creates new tag in database
Updates the UI with the new tag
Tag Editing:
Admin clicks edit button on a tag
Modal opens with pre-filled form
Can modify:
Tag name
Tag description
On submit:
Makes PUT request to /api/tags/[id]
Updates tag in database
Updates the UI
Tag Deletion:
Admin clicks delete button on a tag
Confirmation dialog appears
On confirm:
Makes DELETE request to /api/tags/[id]
Removes tag from database
Updates the UI

Tag Usage in Courses:
Tags can be associated with courses
Each tag shows a count of how many courses are using it
The count is displayed in the tag list
Tags cannot be deleted if they are in use by courses

API Endpoints:
GET /api/tags: List all tags with usage counts
POST /api/tags: Create a new tag
GET /api/tags/[id]: Get a specific tag
PUT /api/tags/[id]: Update a tag
DELETE /api/tags/[id]: Delete a tag

Database Schema:
Apply

Security:
All tag management operations require admin authentication
API routes check for admin role before allowing modifications
Frontend routes are protected by the admin layout
Error Handling:
Validates required fields
Handles duplicate tag names
Prevents deletion of tags in use
Shows error messages for failed operations
Provides feedback for successful operations

UI Components:
Tag list with search and filtering
Add/Edit tag modal
Delete confirmation dialog
Loading states
Error messages
Success notifications
Would you like me to explain any specific part of the workflow in more detail?
