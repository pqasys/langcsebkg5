3001 is only the signaling server. Seeing “[signaling] Ready on http://localhost:3001” and “Signaling server running” there is expected.
The Next.js app runs on 3000. Open http://localhost:3000 to see the homepage.
If 3000 doesn’t load:
Make sure no old dev is still running (stop any “npm run dev” terminals).
Then start fresh: close all dev terminals, run:

npm run dev:turbo:all
Visit http://localhost:3000
Alternatively, run in two terminals:
Terminal A: npm run dev:signaling
Terminal B: npm run dev:next
Visit http://localhost:3000
If 3001 is busy, change signaling port:
PowerShell: $env:SIGNALING_PORT="3002"; npm run dev:turbo:all
App still at http://localhost:3000


3001 is only the signaling server. The app runs on 3000. Open http://localhost:3000.
If 3000 doesn’t load:
Keep the signaling server running (the window that shows “[signaling] Ready on http://localhost:3001”).
In a new PowerShell window, start Next (Turbopack) explicitly:
$env:TURBOPACK="1"; npx next dev
Then visit http://localhost:3000
Tip:
Don’t run multiple copies of the signaling server. If 3001 is “in use”, close the old window or use a different port:
$env:SIGNALING_PORT="3002"; npm run dev:turbo:all
