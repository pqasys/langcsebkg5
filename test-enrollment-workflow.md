# Complete Enrollment Workflow Test

## üéØ **Objective**
Test the complete workflow: Unsubscribed user ‚Üí Course enrollment attempt ‚Üí Subscription signup ‚Üí Automatic enrollment

## üß™ **Test Steps**

### Step 1: Clear Current User's Subscription (Temporary)
1. **Open browser console** on any page
2. **Run this command** to temporarily simulate no subscription:
   ```javascript
   // Temporarily override the subscription check
   window.testNoSubscription = true;
   console.log('Test mode: Simulating no subscription');
   ```

### Step 2: Test Complete Workflow
1. **Go to course page**: `http://localhost:3000/courses/c35b2490-a08e-4c29-9d28-30735f91bd1f`
2. **Click "Enroll Now"** 
3. **Expected**: Should redirect to subscription signup with URL parameters
4. **Check URL**: Should contain `?courseId=c35b2490-a08e-4c29-9d28-30735f91bd1f&fromEnrollment=true`
5. **Check browser console**: Should show sessionStorage being set
6. **Complete subscription signup**: Select Premium plan and click "Start Free Trial"
7. **Expected**: Enrollment confirmation modal should appear
8. **Click "Enroll Now"** in the modal
9. **Expected**: Should successfully enroll and redirect to dashboard

### Step 3: Verify SessionStorage Values
**In browser console, check:**
```javascript
console.log('SessionStorage values:', {
  fromEnrollment: sessionStorage.getItem('fromEnrollment'),
  pendingCourseId: sessionStorage.getItem('pendingCourseEnrollment')
});
```

### Step 4: Check Debug Logs
**Look for these console messages:**
- `üîç SessionStorage after setting:`
- `üîç handlePaymentSuccess debug:`
- `User came from course enrollment, fetching course details...`
- `Course data fetched successfully:`
- `üéØ AutoEnrollmentConfirmationModal should be visible!`

## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### If enrollment confirmation modal doesn't appear:
1. **Check sessionStorage values** in browser console
2. **Verify URL parameters** are correct
3. **Check if course data is fetched** successfully
4. **Look for errors** in browser console

### If user is redirected directly to dashboard:
1. **Check if sessionStorage values are missing**
2. **Verify the subscription success handler** is called
3. **Check if course fetch fails**

## üìã **Expected Results**

‚úÖ **URL Parameters**: `?courseId=...&fromEnrollment=true`
‚úÖ **SessionStorage**: Both values set correctly
‚úÖ **Subscription Creation**: Trial subscription created
‚úÖ **Modal Appearance**: Enrollment confirmation modal shows
‚úÖ **Course Data**: Course details fetched successfully
‚úÖ **Enrollment**: User enrolled automatically
‚úÖ **Redirect**: User redirected to dashboard after enrollment

## üö® **Current Issue**
The user already has an active subscription, so the system doesn't redirect to subscription signup. We need to test with a user who doesn't have a subscription to verify the complete workflow.

## üß™ **Alternative Test: Simulate Enrollment Context**

Since the current user has an active subscription, we can test the enrollment confirmation modal by manually setting the sessionStorage values:

### Step 1: Manually Set SessionStorage
1. **Open browser console** on the subscription signup page
2. **Run these commands**:
   ```javascript
   // Set the enrollment context manually
   sessionStorage.setItem('fromEnrollment', 'true');
   sessionStorage.setItem('pendingCourseEnrollment', 'c35b2490-a08e-4c29-9d28-30735f91bd1f');
   console.log('SessionStorage set manually:', {
     fromEnrollment: sessionStorage.getItem('fromEnrollment'),
     pendingCourseId: sessionStorage.getItem('pendingCourseEnrollment')
   });
   ```

### Step 2: Test Subscription Creation
1. **Select a plan** (Premium)
2. **Click "Start Free Trial"**
3. **Expected**: Should show enrollment confirmation modal
4. **Check console logs** for the debug messages

### Step 3: Verify Modal Behavior
1. **Check if modal appears** with course details
2. **Click "Enroll Now"** in the modal
3. **Expected**: Should enroll and redirect to dashboard
4. **Check if enrollment was successful**

This will help us verify that the enrollment confirmation modal logic is working correctly, even if we can't test the complete redirect flow.
