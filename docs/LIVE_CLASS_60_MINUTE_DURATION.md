# Live Class 60-Minute Duration Implementation

## Overview

Live class lessons are now standardized to a fixed 60-minute duration. The system automatically calculates the end time based on the start time, making the end time field read-only in all create and edit forms.

## Changes Made

### 1. Admin Live Class Create Form
**File**: `app/admin/live-classes/create/page.tsx`

- **Auto-calculation**: When start time is set, end time is automatically calculated as 60 minutes later
- **Read-only end time**: End time field is now read-only with visual styling to indicate it's auto-calculated
- **Informational note**: Added blue info box explaining the 60-minute fixed duration

### 2. Institution Live Class Create Form
**File**: `app/institution/live-classes/create/page.tsx`

- **Auto-calculation**: Same auto-calculation logic as admin form
- **Read-only end time**: End time field is read-only
- **Informational note**: Added blue info box explaining the 60-minute fixed duration

### 3. Video Session Create Component
**File**: `components/live-classes/VideoSessionCreate.tsx`

- **Auto-calculation**: Same auto-calculation logic
- **Read-only end time**: End time field is read-only
- **Informational note**: Added blue info box explaining the 60-minute fixed duration

### 4. Admin Live Class Edit Form
**File**: `app/admin/live-classes/[id]/edit/page.tsx`

- **Auto-calculation**: When start time is modified, end time is automatically recalculated
- **Read-only end time**: End time field is read-only
- **Informational note**: Added blue info box explaining the 60-minute fixed duration
- **Clock icon**: Added Clock icon import for the informational note

## Technical Implementation

### Auto-calculation Logic
```typescript
const handleInputChange = (field: keyof LiveClassFormData, value: any) => {
  setFormData(prev => {
    const updated = {
      ...prev,
      [field]: value
    };

    // Auto-compute end time when start time changes (60-minute duration)
    if (field === 'startTime' && value) {
      const startTime = new Date(value);
      const endTime = new Date(startTime.getTime() + 60 * 60 * 1000); // Add 60 minutes
      updated.endTime = endTime.toISOString().slice(0, 16); // Format for datetime-local input
    }

    return updated;
  });
};
```

### UI Changes
- **End time label**: Changed from "End Time *" to "End Time (Auto-calculated)"
- **Read-only styling**: Added `readOnly`, `className="bg-gray-50 cursor-not-allowed"`, and `title` attribute
- **Informational note**: Blue box with Clock icon explaining the 60-minute duration

## User Experience

### Before
- Users had to manually set both start and end times
- No consistency in session durations
- Potential for user errors in time calculations

### After
- Users only need to set the start time
- End time is automatically calculated and displayed
- Clear visual indication that end time is auto-calculated
- Consistent 60-minute duration across all live classes

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All live classes now have the same 60-minute duration
2. **User-friendly**: Reduces user effort and potential errors
3. **Subscription alignment**: Matches the subscription system's hour-based tracking
4. **Clear communication**: Users understand the fixed duration policy

## Future Considerations

The system is designed to be flexible for future requirements:
- The auto-calculation logic can be easily modified if duration requirements change
- The read-only status can be made conditional based on user roles or settings
- Different durations could be supported for different session types

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with:
- ✅ Build compilation successful
- ✅ All forms properly handle the auto-calculation
- ✅ Read-only styling is applied correctly
- ✅ Informational notes are displayed appropriately
