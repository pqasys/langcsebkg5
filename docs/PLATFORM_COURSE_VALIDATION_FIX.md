# Platform Course Validation Fix

## Problem Description

Platform-wide courses (live classes) were being created with `institutionId: null` (which is correct), but the admin courses page validation was throwing an error when trying to edit these courses because it expected an institution to be present.

**Error Message:**
```
Course "Global English Mastery - Live Platform Course" is missing institution information. This is a data integrity issue that needs to be resolved.
```

## Root Cause

The validation logic in `app/admin/courses/page.tsx` was checking if a course has an institution, but for platform-wide courses, the `institutionId` should be `null` and that's perfectly valid.

**Old Validation Logic:**
```typescript
if (!course.institution || !course.institution.id) {
  throw new Error(`Course "${course.title}" is missing institution information. This is a data integrity issue that needs to be resolved.`);
}
```

## Solution

Modified the validation logic to allow platform courses to have no institution by checking the `isPlatformCourse` flag.

**New Validation Logic:**
```typescript
// For platform courses, institution can be null
if (!course.isPlatformCourse && (!course.institution || !course.institution.id)) {
  throw new Error(`Course "${course.title}" is missing institution information. This is a data integrity issue that needs to be resolved.`);
}
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Validation Logic (`app/admin/courses/page.tsx`)

**Lines 1076-1078:**
- Added check for `isPlatformCourse` flag before requiring institution
- Platform courses can now have `institutionId: null`

### 2. Updated Form Data Initialization (`app/admin/courses/page.tsx`)

**Line 1095:**
- Changed from `institutionId: course.institution.id` to `institutionId: course.isPlatformCourse ? '' : course.institution?.id || ''`
- Platform courses now get empty string for form field

### 3. Updated Schema Validation (`app/admin/courses/page.tsx`)

**Line 147:**
- Changed from `institutionId: z.string().min(1, 'Institution is required')` to `institutionId: z.string().optional()`
- Allows empty/invalid institutionId for platform courses

## Database Schema

The database schema already supports this correctly:

```prisma
model Course {
  // ...
  institutionId        String?          @db.VarChar(36)  // Optional
  isPlatformCourse     Boolean          @default(false)  // Platform flag
  // ...
  institution Institution? @relation(fields: [institutionId], references: [id], onDelete: SetNull, onUpdate: Cascade)
}
```

## API Support

The admin courses API already handles platform courses correctly:

```typescript
// In app/api/admin/courses/route.ts
institutionId: institutionId || null, // Allow null for platform-wide courses
```

## Testing

Created test script `scripts/test-platform-course-fix.ts` to verify the fix:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-platform-course-fix.ts
```

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Platform course found with `institutionId: null`
- ✅ Old validation fails (as expected)
- ✅ New validation passes for platform courses
- ✅ Form initialization works correctly
- ✅ No orphaned courses found

## Platform Course Example

The "Global English Mastery - Live Platform Course" is correctly configured:

```typescript
{
  title: 'Global English Mastery - Live Platform Course',
  institutionId: null,           // No specific institution
  isPlatformCourse: true,        // Marked as platform course
  courseType: 'LIVE_ONLY',
  deliveryMode: 'LIVE_INTERACTIVE',
  enrollmentType: 'SUBSCRIPTION_BASED',
  hasLiveClasses: true,
  requiresSubscription: true
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Semantic Correctness**: Platform courses don't belong to any specific institution
2. **Data Integrity**: Maintains proper relationships in the database
3. **User Experience**: Admins can now edit platform courses without errors
4. **Scalability**: Supports both institution-specific and platform-wide courses
