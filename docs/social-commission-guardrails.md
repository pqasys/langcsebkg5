## Balancing social interaction with commission protection

### Short answer
Blend incentives with guardrails: make on-platform the easiest, safest, and most rewarding way to progress, while technically and contractually discouraging premature off-platform contact.

### What to implement

- **Segment the experience**
  - Keep open "social learning" spaces fully social.
  - Funnel "institution–prospect" contact into a guided flow with clear stages.

- **Mask PII until commitment**
  - On-platform chat/calls with email/phone masking and relays.
  - NLP redaction of emails/phones/handles in messages and attachments.
  - Allow PII only after a milestone (e.g., paid deposit or verified intent).

- **Milestone-based unlocks**
  - Reveal contact details after: application submitted, small refundable deposit, or signed intent.
  - Provide a timed, auditable handover window to the institution.

- **Value moats for staying on-platform**
  - Guarantees (refund/price protection), financing, scholarships, counselor support.
  - Verified reviews, progress tracking, document workflow, visa/relocation help.
  - Dispute resolution and fraud protection only if communication/payment stayed on-platform.

- **Payments and escrow**
  - Application and tuition deposits handled via platform escrow.
  - Commission clearing tied to platform-recorded milestones; automated invoicing for institutions.

- **Pricing and contracts**
  - Hybrid pricing: light SaaS fee + lower success commission, or higher commission with no SaaS.
  - "Attribution window" clause (e.g., 6–12 months): if a prospect you introduced enrolls, commission applies even off-platform.
  - Anti-steering and fair-use terms; transparent to users and schools.

- **Detection and enforcement**
  - PII detection and throttling; "nudge" prompts explaining why sharing is blocked.
  - Risk scoring: rapid PII attempts, external links, repeated obfuscation → stricter gates.
  - Institution dashboards with lead pipelines so they don’t need to jump off-platform.

- **Measurement and experiments**
  - Track: disintermediation attempts, conversion, time-to-contact, NPS, LTV, take rate.
  - A/B test unlock thresholds, nudges, and guarantees.
  - Monitor false positives to avoid over-blocking legit collaboration.

- **Integrations**
  - CRM/SIS hooks for institutions; auto-sync applications and enrollments to reduce off-platform needs.
  - Click-tracking and signed webhooks to support attribution windows.

- **Rollout plan**
  - Phase 1: PII redaction, masked comms, guarantees, escrow.
  - Phase 2: CRM integrations, recorded/relayed calls, document workflows.
  - Phase 3: Pricing/contract updates, attribution windows, optimize gates via A/B tests.

- **User trust**
  - Clearly communicate: "Share contacts after [milestone]. Staying on-platform gives you X, Y, Z protections."

- **Allow controlled exceptions**
  - Alumni networking stays open; institution–prospect PII only after defined milestones.

- **Fail-safe UX**
  - If users try to bypass, offer a one-click "Request official handover" that preserves attribution and benefits.

### Brief summary
- Gate PII with masked comms and milestone-based unlocks.
- Make on-platform superior via guarantees, tooling, and escrow.
- Backstop with attribution-window contracts, CRM integrations, and smart detection—then iterate based on measured disintermediation and conversion.
