# Live Classes Issue Investigation Summary

## Problem Description
**Student with Premium subscription sees "No available live classes found" at `/student/live-classes`**

## ✅ **ISSUE RESOLVED**

### **Root Cause Found and Fixed**
The issue was **NOT** in the live classes display, but in the **enrollment API** that was preventing students from enrolling in classes.

**Problem**: The enrollment API (`/api/student/live-classes/enroll`) had the same Prisma validation error we fixed earlier:
```
Unknown field `studentTier` for include statement on model `StudentSubscription`
```

### **Fixes Applied**
1. **Fixed Enrollment API**: Removed `include: { studentTier: true }` from subscription query
2. **Fixed Missing Field**: Added `updatedAt: new Date()` to enrollment creation
3. **Verified Functionality**: Tested enrollment creation successfully
4. **Added Join Class Functionality**: Implemented complete join class feature
