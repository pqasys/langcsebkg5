# Course Prioritization and Advertising System

## Overview

The Course Prioritization and Advertising System is a comprehensive revenue optimization platform that maximizes site revenue through strategic course placement, premium features, and targeted advertising real estate. This system ensures that high-value courses and institutions receive optimal visibility while providing multiple revenue streams through advertising and premium placement.

## Key Features

### 1. Advanced Course Prioritization Algorithm

The system uses a sophisticated scoring algorithm that considers multiple factors:

```typescript
// Priority Score Calculation
let priorityScore = 0;

// Featured institution bonus (highest priority)
if (course.institution.isFeatured) {
  priorityScore += 1000;
}

// Commission rate bonus (0-50 points based on rate)
priorityScore += (course.institution.commissionRate || 0) * 10;

// Subscription plan bonus
const planBonus = {
  'BASIC': 0,
  'PROFESSIONAL': 50,
  'ENTERPRISE': 100
};
priorityScore += planBonus[course.institution.subscriptionPlan] || 0;

// Recency bonus (newer courses get slight boost)
const daysSinceCreation = Math.floor((Date.now() - new Date(course.createdAt).getTime()) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
priorityScore += Math.max(0, 30 - daysSinceCreation);

// Start date proximity bonus (sooner courses get boost)
const daysUntilStart = Math.floor((new Date(course.startDate).getTime() - Date.now()) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
priorityScore += Math.max(0, 30 - daysUntilStart);
```

### 2. Priority Indicators and Badges

Courses display visual indicators based on their priority level:

- **Featured Badge** (Orange): Highest priority, 1000+ points
