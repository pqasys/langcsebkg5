## Refund and litigation risk mitigation strategy

The platform currently collects full payment, deducts commission, and pays the institution after a hold period (e.g., 14–28 days). Below are additional ways to further insulate the platform from refunds and litigation.

### Legal and contractual
- **Clarify marketplace role**: institution is the educator and primary liable party; platform acts as facilitator/agent.
- **Dispute clauses**: mandatory arbitration, class-action waiver, forum selection, warranty disclaimers, and liability caps (where lawful).
- **Explicit acceptance**: clickwrap of refund policy and exceptions with timestamps and IP/device data.
- **Indemnities and insurance**: institutions indemnify platform and maintain E&O insurance naming platform as additional insured.

### Payment architecture
- **Split-pay rails**: use marketplace rails (e.g., separate charges/transfers) and make the institution the merchant-of-record where feasible.
- **Milestone releases**: deposit at enrollment, partial after first-attendance week, balance after census date.
- **Reserves/holdbacks**: dynamic rolling reserves based on partner risk and historical refunds.
- **Lower-chargeback rails**: prefer ACH/SEPA for large tuitions; enable SCA/3DS on cards.

### Refund policy engineering
- **Cooling-off window**: pre-start refund window with clear cutoffs; explicit waiver once content/attendance begins (jurisdiction-appropriate).
- **Pro‑rata approach**: tie refunds to attendance/consumption; prefer credits over cash where permissible.
- **Remedy-first**: re-accommodation/alternate cohort before cash refunds.
- **Non‑refundable components**: transparent application fees/seat deposits.

### Risk controls and reserves
- **Learner protection fund**: separate fund for disputes; avoid impacting platform operating cash.
- **Partner reserves/bonds**: performance bonds or security deposits for higher-risk institutions.
- **Financing partners**: BNPL/loans to shift default/refund risk off-platform when appropriate.

### Chargeback and fraud mitigation
- **Evidence program**: signed terms, attendance logs, content access logs, chat/call records, delivery proofs.
- **Card network tools**: clean descriptors, pre-start reminders, Order Insight/RDR/CE 3.0 data where available.
- **KYC/KYB and IDV**: verify institutions and students; add velocity/anomaly checks.

### Compliance and disclosures
- **Local law alignment**: match cooling-off and education-specific consumer rules by market.
- **Transparent claims**: clear pricing, schedule, and outcomes disclaimers; avoid misleading marketing.
- **Tax handling**: correct VAT/GST treatment to reduce regulatory risk.

### Operational safeguards
- **On-platform dispute flow**: mandatory internal resolution and cooling period before card disputes.
- **Delivery SLAs**: attendance and delivery SLAs; missed SLAs trigger institution-funded remedies.
- **Evidence retention**: retain transaction and delivery evidence per policy and card rules.

### UX nudges that reduce refunds
- **Expectation setting**: pre-start checklist and expectations agreement.
- **Early check-ins**: satisfaction checkpoint with quick support options.
- **Value-preserving remedies**: partial refunds as credits/scholarships where appropriate.

### Partner obligations
- **Tiered payout schedules**: longer escrow for new/high-risk partners.
- **Chargeback pass-through**: auto-deduct from next payouts/reserve.
- **Quality controls**: audits and delisting for high-refund partners.

### Default operating playbook
- Separate charges/transfers with platform fee; institution as MoR where possible.
- 3-part payout: deposit at enroll, partial after week 1 attendance, final after census date; maintain rolling reserve.
- Terms: arbitration + liability cap + withdrawal waiver on start; explicit refund matrix.
- Evidence: auto-capture attendance, access, communications; enable 3DS/SCA and network dispute tools.
- Create learner protection fund and require institution E&O insurance.
