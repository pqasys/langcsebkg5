# Subscription Streams Rationalization Plan

## ðŸŽ¯ **Current State Analysis**

### **Problem: Too Many Conflicting Subscription Streams**

The platform currently has **multiple overlapping and confusing subscription models**:

1. **Student Subscriptions** (Multiple Sources)
   - `StudentTier` database model: $12.99, $24.99, $49.99
   - Hardcoded in components: $9.99, $19.99, $49.99
   - Feature pages: $19.99 for Live Conversations
   - Registration pages: $12.99, $24.99, $49.99

2. **Institution Subscriptions** (Multiple Sources)
   - `CommissionTier` database model: $99, $299, $799
   - Hardcoded in components: $129, $399, $2000
   - Public pages: $99, $299, $999
   - Service files: $129, $399, $2000

3. **Feature-Specific Pricing** (Isolated)
   - Live Conversations: $19.99/month
   - Community Learning: $9.99/month
   - Video Conferencing: $24.99/month (proposed)

4. **Inconsistent Pricing Across Files**
   - Same features priced differently in different components
   - No single source of truth for pricing
   - Confusing user experience

## ðŸš€ **Proposed Rationalized Structure**

### **1. Unified Student Subscription Tiers**

| Tier | Price | Target | Key Features | Limits |
|------|-------|--------|--------------|---------|
| **BASIC** | $12.99/month | Beginners | Basic lessons, Progress tracking, Email support | 5 languages, 5 courses |
| **PREMIUM** | $24.99/month | Serious learners | Live conversations, AI assistant, Priority support | All languages, 20 courses |
| **PRO** | $49.99/month | Advanced learners | Personal tutoring, Custom learning paths, 24/7 support | All languages, Unlimited courses |

### **2. Unified Institution Subscription Tiers**

| Tier | Price | Commission | Target | Key Features | Limits |
|------|-------|------------|--------|--------------|---------|
| **STARTER** | $99/month | 25% | Small schools | Basic analytics, Email support | 50 students, 5 courses, 2 teachers |
| **PROFESSIONAL** | $299/month | 15% | Growing institutions | Advanced analytics, Custom branding, Priority support | 200 students, 15 courses, 5 teachers |
| **ENTERPRISE** | $799/month | 10% | Large organizations | All features, API access, White label | 1000 students, 50 courses, 20 teachers |

## ðŸ”§ **Implementation Plan**

```sql
-- Standardize student tier pricing
UPDATE student_tiers SET 
  price = 12.99,
  name = 'Basic Plan',
  description = 'Perfect for beginners starting their language journey'
WHERE planType = 'BASIC';

UPDATE student_tiers SET 
  price = 24.99,
  name = 'Premium Plan', 
  description = 'Most popular choice for serious language learners'
WHERE planType = 'PREMIUM';

UPDATE commission_tiers SET 
  price = 299,
  name = 'Professional Plan',
  description = 'Ideal for growing institutions with multiple courses'

      annualPrice: 129.99,
      features: ['basicLessons', 'progressTracking', 'emailSupport', 'mobileAccess']
    },
    PREMIUM: {
      price: 24.99,
      annualPrice: 249.99,
      features: ['basicLessons', 'progressTracking', 'liveConversations', 'aiAssistant', 'prioritySupport', 'videoConferencing']
    },
    PRO: {
      price: 49.99,
      annualPrice: 499.99,
      features: ['allFeatures', 'personalTutoring', 'customLearningPaths', 'dedicatedSupport']
    }
  },
  INSTITUTION: {
    STARTER: {
      price: 99,
      annualPrice: 990,
      commissionRate: 25,
      features: ['basicAnalytics', 'emailSupport', 'courseManagement']
    },

      annualPrice: 2990,
      commissionRate: 15,
      features: ['advancedAnalytics', 'customBranding', 'prioritySupport', 'videoConferencing']
    },
    ENTERPRISE: {
      price: 799,
      annualPrice: 7990,
      commissionRate: 10,
      features: ['allFeatures', 'apiAccess', 'whiteLabel', 'dedicatedManager']
