# Revenue API Fix Summary

## 🐛 **Issue Identified**

The admin revenue API was failing with a 500 error when trying to access revenue breakdown data:

```
Error getting revenue data:
GET /api/admin/revenue?startDate=2025-07-08T17:15:18.247Z&endDate=2025-08-08T17:15:18.247Z&type=breakdown 500 in 532ms
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Prisma Relation Errors**
The issue was caused by the same pattern of problems we encountered with the payment APIs:

1. **Missing `enrollment` Relation**: The `RevenueTrackingService` was trying to include an `enrollment` relation on the `Payment` model, which doesn't exist in the Prisma schema.

2. **Missing `subscription` Relation**: The service was trying to include a `subscription` relation on the `InstitutionBillingHistory` model, which also doesn't exist.

3. **Missing `student` Relation**: The service was trying to include a `student` relation on the `StudentSubscription` model, which also doesn't exist.

### **Schema Issues**
```prisma
// Payment model has enrollmentId but no enrollment relation
model Payment {
  enrollmentId String  // ✅ Field exists
  // enrollment relation ❌ Does not exist
}

// InstitutionBillingHistory has subscriptionId but no subscription relation
model InstitutionBillingHistory {
  subscriptionId String  // ✅ Field exists
  // subscription relation ❌ Does not exist
}

// StudentSubscription has studentId but no student relation
model StudentSubscription {
  studentId String  // ✅ Field exists
  // student relation ❌ Does not exist
}
```

### **Affected Methods**
The following methods in `RevenueTrackingService` were affected:
1. `getRevenueMetrics()` - Used non-existent `enrollment` and `student` relations
2. `getRevenueBreakdown()` - Used non-existent `enrollment` and `subscription` relations

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Two-Step Query Strategy**
Implemented the same successful pattern used for payment APIs:

```typescript
// Step 1: Query payments with basic data
const payments = await prisma.payment.findMany({
  where: { /* conditions */ },
  select: {
    id: true,
    amount: true,
    commissionAmount: true,
    enrollmentId: true,
    createdAt: true
  }
});

// Step 2: Query enrollments separately
const enrollmentIds = [...new Set(payments.map(p => p.enrollmentId).filter(Boolean))];
const enrollments = await prisma.studentCourseEnrollment.findMany({
  where: { id: { in: enrollmentIds } },
  include: {
    course: {
      include: { institution: true }
    }
  }
});

// Step 3: Create lookup map
const enrollmentMap = new Map(enrollments.map(e => [e.id, e]));
```

### **2. Institution Billing History Fix**
Applied the same pattern for institution billing history:

```typescript
// Step 1: Query billing history with basic data
const institutionSubscriptions = await prisma.institutionBillingHistory.findMany({
  where: { /* conditions */ },
  select: {
    id: true,
    amount: true,
    subscriptionId: true,
    billingDate: true
  }
});

// Step 2: Query subscriptions separately
const subscriptionIds = [...new Set(institutionSubscriptions.map(b => b.subscriptionId).filter(Boolean))];
const subscriptions = await prisma.institutionSubscription.findMany({
  where: { id: { in: subscriptionIds } },
  include: {
    institution: true,
    commissionTier: true,
  },
});

// Step 3: Create lookup map
const subscriptionMap = new Map(subscriptions.map(s => [s.id, s]));
```

### **3. Student Subscription Fix**
Applied the same pattern for student subscriptions:

```typescript
// Step 1: Query student billing history with basic data
const studentSubscriptions = await prisma.studentBillingHistory.findMany({
  where: { /* conditions */ },
  select: {
    id: true,
    amount: true,
    subscriptionId: true,
    billingDate: true
  }
});

// Step 2: Query student subscriptions separately
const studentSubscriptionIds = [...new Set(studentSubscriptions.map(b => b.subscriptionId).filter(Boolean))];
const studentSubscriptionsData = await prisma.studentSubscription.findMany({
  where: { id: { in: studentSubscriptionIds } },
  include: {
    studentTier: true, // Only include existing relation
  },
});

// Step 3: Create lookup map
const studentSubscriptionMap = new Map(studentSubscriptionsData.map(s => [s.id, s]));
```

### **4. Data Processing Updates**
Updated all data processing logic to use the lookup maps:

```typescript
// Before (failing)
const institutionName = payment.enrollment.course.institution.name;

// After (working)
const enrollment = enrollmentMap.get(payment.enrollmentId);
if (!enrollment) return; // Skip if enrollment not found
const institutionName = enrollment.course.institution.name;
```

## 📊 **Fixed Methods**
