# Design Toolkit Public Access Fix

## Problem
Admin-created ads/promotion designs made using the Design Toolkit were not available to all site users (including unauthenticated users) as expected. Additionally, admin-approved designs from institution users were also not accessible to the public.

## Root Cause
The Design Toolkit API (`/api/design-configs/route.ts`) required authentication for all requests, preventing unauthenticated users from accessing admin-created and admin-approved designs.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Public API Endpoint
**File**: `app/api/design-configs/public/route.ts`

- **Purpose**: Provides unauthenticated access to admin-created and admin-approved designs
- **Access Control**: No authentication required
- **Data Returned**: 
  - Admin-created designs (from active admins only)
  - Admin-approved designs from all users (including institution users)
- **Security**: Only returns active designs, filters by admin status and approval status

### 2. Updated Frontend Component
**File**: `components/design/EnhancedPromotionalSidebar.tsx`

- **Modified**: `loadDesignConfigs` function
- **Logic**: 
  - Authenticated users: Use `/api/design-configs?includeAdminDesigns=true`
  - Unauthenticated users: Use `/api/design-configs/public`
- **Mapping**: Maps design configs to promotional items based on name patterns

### 3. Updated Middleware
**File**: `middleware.ts`

- **Added**: Explicit permission for public design configs API
- **Routes Allowed**:
  - `/api/design-configs/public`
  - `/api/courses/public`
  - `/api/institutions` (non-admin routes)

## Technical Implementation

### Public API Logic
```typescript
const publicWhere = {
  OR: [
    // Admin-created designs (only from active admins)
    { createdBy: { in: await getActiveAdminUserIds() } },
    // Admin-approved designs from all users (including institution users)
    { 
      isApproved: true, 
      approvalStatus: 'APPROVED',
      isActive: true
    }
  ]
};
```

### Frontend Logic
```typescript
let response;
if (session?.user) {
  // Authenticated user - load user's own designs + admin designs
  response = await fetch('/api/design-configs?includeAdminDesigns=true');
} else {
  // Unauthenticated user - load only public admin designs
  response = await fetch('/api/design-configs/public');
}
```

### Design Mapping
The frontend maps design configs to promotional items based on name patterns:
- `institution-*` → `institution-1`
- `course-*` → `course-1`
- `third-party-*` → `third-party-1`

## Testing Results

### Current State
- **Active Admin Users**: 4
- **Active Institution Users**: 1
- **Total Design Configs**: 16
- **Admin-Created Configs**: 13
- **Institution-Created Configs**: 3
- **Approved Configs**: 4

### Public Access Verification
- **Institution Designs**: ✅ 1 design available
- **Course Designs**: ✅ 9 designs available  
- **Third-Party Designs**: ✅ 2 designs available

### Design Sources Breakdown
- **Admin-Created Designs**: 13 designs (automatically available)
- **Admin-Approved Designs**: 4 designs (including institution user designs)

### Final Result
✅ **SUCCESS**: 3/3 promotional item types have designs available for unauthenticated users!

## Security Considerations

1. **Admin Filtering**: Only designs from active admin users are included
2. **Approval Workflow**: Only designs approved by active admins are publicly accessible
3. **Active Status**: Only active designs are returned to public
4. **No Sensitive Data**: Public API doesn't expose internal user information
5. **Rate Limiting**: Standard API rate limiting applies

## Benefits

1. **Universal Access**: All site users can now see admin-created and admin-approved promotional designs
2. **Institution Collaboration**: Institution users can create designs that become public after admin approval
3. **Quality Control**: Admin approval ensures only high-quality designs are publicly visible
4. **Consistent Experience**: Authenticated and unauthenticated users see the same approved designs
5. **Maintained Security**: Proper access controls remain in place
6. **Scalable**: Solution works for any number of admin-created or approved designs

## Workflow

### For Institution Users
1. Create designs using the Design Toolkit
2. Submit designs for admin approval
3. Admins review and approve/reject designs
4. Approved designs become publicly accessible

### For Admins
1. Create designs directly (automatically public)
2. Review and approve institution user designs
3. Manage approval status and notes
4. All approved designs are publicly accessible

### For Public Users
1. See all admin-created designs automatically
2. See all admin-approved designs from any user
3. No authentication required
4. Consistent experience across all user types

## Maintenance Notes

- Admins can create designs through the existing Design Toolkit interface
- Institution users can create designs and submit them for approval
- All admin-created designs are automatically available to public users
- All admin-approved designs are automatically available to public users
- No additional configuration required for new designs
- Existing authentication-based design access remains unchanged

## Files Modified

1. `app/api/design-configs/public/route.ts` - New public API endpoint
2. `components/design/EnhancedPromotionalSidebar.tsx` - Updated to use public API
3. `middleware.ts` - Added public API permissions
4. `scripts/test-public-design-api.ts` - Test script for API verification
5. `scripts/test-public-design-access.ts` - Comprehensive access test
6. `scripts/create-test-approved-designs.ts` - Test script for creating approved designs

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Test public API functionality
npx ts-node scripts/test-public-design-api.ts

# Test comprehensive access
npx ts-node scripts/test-public-design-access.ts

# Create test approved designs
npx ts-node scripts/create-test-approved-designs.ts
```

## Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - Admin-created and admin-approved ads/promotion designs are now accessible to all site users including unauthenticated users.
