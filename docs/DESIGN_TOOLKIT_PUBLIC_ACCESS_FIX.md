# Design Toolkit Public Access Fix

## Problem
Admin's ads/promotion designs made using the Design Toolkit were not available to all site users (including unauthenticated users) as expected. Additionally, the Design Toolkit needed to be implemented on the `/courses` page promotional banners that are controlled by the "Show/Hide Ads" button.

## Root Cause
1. The existing API endpoint (`/api/design-configs`) required user authentication, preventing unauthenticated users from accessing admin-created and admin-approved designs.
2. The `/courses` page promotional banners (Premium Course Banner, Featured Institution Banner, and Promotional Banner) were not integrated with the Design Toolkit.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Public API Endpoint
Created a new public API endpoint (`/api/design-configs/public`) that provides unauthenticated access to:
- Designs created by active `ADMIN` users
- Designs that are explicitly `isApproved: true`, have `approvalStatus: 'APPROVED'`, and are `isActive: true` (including designs created by institution users that have been approved by an admin)

### 2. Frontend Integration
Updated the frontend components to conditionally fetch design configurations:
- If a user session exists, fetch from the authenticated `/api/design-configs?includeAdminDesigns=true`
- If no session exists (unauthenticated user), fetch from the new public API endpoint `/api/design-configs/public`

### 3. Courses Page Design Toolkit Integration
Implemented the Design Toolkit on the `/courses` page for the three promotional banners controlled by the "Show/Hide Ads" button:

#### Banner Types:
1. **Premium Course Banner** (`premium-course-banner`)
   - Default: Purple gradient background (original AdvertisingBanner styling)
   - Displays top premium/featured courses

2. **Featured Institution Banner** (`featured-institution-banner`)
   - Default: Orange gradient background (original AdvertisingBanner styling)
   - Displays featured institutions

3. **Promotional Banner** (`promotional-banner`)
   - Default: Green gradient background (original AdvertisingBanner styling)
   - Displays promotional offers and deals

#### Implementation Details:
- Created `DesignableAdvertisingBanner` component with full Design Toolkit support
- Updated `CoursesPageClient` to use designable banners instead of static ones
- Added Design Toolkit panel that appears when editing banner designs
- Integrated with existing public access system for unauthenticated users

### 4. Middleware Updates
Updated `middleware.ts` to explicitly allow unauthenticated access to the new public API endpoints.

## Technical Details

### Public API Data Returned
The public API returns design configurations that meet either of these criteria:
- `createdBy` is an active admin user ID
- `isApproved: true` AND `approvalStatus: 'APPROVED'` AND `isActive: true`

### Design Configuration Mapping
The frontend maps database configurations to promotional item IDs:
- `premium-course-banner` - Premium course advertising
- `featured-institution-banner` - Featured institution advertising  
- `promotional-banner` - General promotional content
- `institution-1` - Institution promotional items
- `course-1` - Course promotional items
- `third-party-1` - Third-party promotional items

### Security Considerations
- Only designs approved by active admins are publicly accessible
- Unauthenticated users cannot modify designs
- Design changes require appropriate user permissions (ADMIN or INSTITUTION_STAFF)
- All design configurations are validated before saving

## Benefits
1. **Universal Access**: All site users (including unauthenticated) can now see admin-created and admin-approved promotional designs
2. **Consistent Branding**: Admin-approved designs ensure consistent visual identity across the platform
3. **Flexible Design System**: Admins and institution staff can customize promotional content using the Design Toolkit
4. **Enhanced User Experience**: Professional, branded promotional content improves user engagement
5. **Scalable Solution**: The system supports multiple promotional item types and can be extended to other pages

## Workflow

### For Institution Users:
1. Create promotional designs using the Design Toolkit
2. Submit designs for admin approval
3. Once approved, designs become publicly accessible to all users

### For Admins:
1. Create promotional designs using the Design Toolkit
2. Approve designs from institution users
3. All admin-created and admin-approved designs are immediately publicly accessible

### For Public Users (Unauthenticated):
1. View promotional content with admin-approved designs applied
2. Experience consistent, professional branding across the platform

### For Courses Page:
1. Admins and institution staff see "Show Design Toolkit" button
2. Click edit button on any promotional banner to open Design Toolkit
3. Customize colors, fonts, backgrounds, and other design elements
4. Save changes to database
5. All users (including unauthenticated) see the updated designs

## Testing Results
- ✅ Public API returns admin-created and admin-approved designs
- ✅ Frontend correctly loads designs for both authenticated and unauthenticated users
- ✅ Design configurations are properly mapped to promotional items
- ✅ Courses page banners are fully integrated with Design Toolkit
- ✅ All 3 promotional banner types have default designs
- ✅ Design changes are saved to database and persist across sessions
- ✅ Unauthenticated users can see all approved designs

## Files Modified
1. `app/api/design-configs/public/route.ts` - New public API endpoint
2. `components/design/EnhancedPromotionalSidebar.tsx` - Updated to use public API
3. `middleware.ts` - Added public API access permissions
4. `components/design/DesignableAdvertisingBanner.tsx` - New designable banner component
5. `components/CoursesPageClient.tsx` - Integrated Design Toolkit for promotional banners
6. `scripts/create-courses-page-designs.ts` - Script to create default designs
7. `scripts/test-courses-page-design-toolkit.ts` - Test script for verification

## Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - Admin-created and admin-approved ads/promotion designs are now accessible to all site users including unauthenticated users. The Design Toolkit has been successfully implemented on the `/courses` page promotional banners, allowing admins and institution staff to customize the appearance of promotional content while ensuring all users see the approved designs.
