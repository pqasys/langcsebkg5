## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### Database Schema Changes

#### Updated `CommunityCircleEvent` Model
```prisma
model CommunityCircleEvent {
  // ... existing fields
  type: String // Now includes 'live-class'
  attendees: CommunityCircleEventAttendee[]
  // ... other fields
}
```

#### New `CommunityCircleEventAttendee` Model
```prisma
model CommunityCircleEventAttendee {
  id: String @id @default(cuid())
  eventId: String
  userId: String
  joinedAt: DateTime @default(now())
  status: String @default("REGISTERED") // REGISTERED, ATTENDED, NO_SHOW
  
  event: CommunityCircleEvent @relation(fields: [eventId], references: [id])
  user: user @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  
  @@unique([eventId, userId])
}
```

### Access Control Service

#### `lib/community-live-class-access.ts`
- **`checkUserAccess()`**: Determines user's access level based on subscription
- **`getUserSessionUsage()`**: Tracks monthly session usage
- **`canJoinLiveClass()`**: Validates if user can join specific session
- **`validateEventCreation()`**: Applies restrictions to event creation
- **`getUpgradePrompt()`**: Generates contextual upgrade messages

### Access Levels

#### Free Users
```typescript
{
  hasAccess: true,
  restrictions: {
    maxSessionsPerMonth: 1,
    sessionDuration: 30,
    groupSize: 'large',
    features: ['basic-video', 'chat'],
    restrictions: ['no-recording', 'no-materials', 'no-hd-video']
  }
}
```

#### Premium Users
```typescript
{
  hasAccess: true,
  restrictions: {
    maxSessionsPerMonth: 10,
    sessionDuration: 60,
    groupSize: 'small',
    features: ['hd-video', 'chat', 'screen-share', 'materials'],
    restrictions: ['no-recording']
  }
}
```

#### Pro Users
```typescript
{
  hasAccess: true,
  restrictions: {
    maxSessionsPerMonth: -1, // Unlimited
    sessionDuration: 120,
    groupSize: 'personal',
    features: ['all-features'],
    restrictions: []
  }
}
```

### API Endpoints

#### Event Creation with Access Controls
**`POST /api/community/circles/[slug]/events`**
- Validates event creation based on user's subscription
- Applies duration and group size restrictions
- Returns upgrade prompts when restrictions are violated

#### Event Joining with Access Controls
**`POST /api/community/circles/[slug]/events/[eventId]/join`**
- Checks monthly session limits
- Validates user's access level
- Returns contextual upgrade prompts

#### Enhanced Event Fetching
**`GET /api/community/circles/[slug]/events`**
- Includes access control information for each event
- Shows upgrade prompts for restricted users
- Displays attendee counts and creator information

### Frontend Components

#### Enhanced Event Creation Dialog
- Live Class specific fields (video platform, meeting link, difficulty, language)
- Real-time validation with restriction feedback
- Freemium notice with upgrade links

#### Upgrade Prompt Modal
**`components/UpgradePromptModal.tsx`**
- Beautiful comparison between current and upgraded plans
- Contextual messaging based on user's limitation
- Direct navigation to subscription signup

#### Enhanced Event Display
- Live Class specific information (platform, difficulty, language)
- Access control status for each event
- Join buttons with upgrade prompts when needed

## üéØ User Experience Flow

### 1. **First-Time User**
1. User discovers Live Classes in Community Circle
2. Sees "1 free session/month" notice
3. Creates or joins their first session
4. After session, receives upgrade prompt: "Loved your first session? Get unlimited access!"

### 2. **Monthly Limit Reached**
1. User tries to join second session in same month
2. Sees clear message: "You've reached your monthly limit of 1 sessions"
3. Upgrade prompt: "Upgrade to Premium for unlimited live class sessions!"

### 3. **Session Creation Restrictions**
1. Free user tries to create 45-minute session
2. Validation error: "Free users can only create sessions up to 30 minutes"
3. Upgrade prompt with feature comparison

### 4. **Progressive Upselling**
- **After 1 session**: "Get unlimited access with Premium!"
- **After 5 sessions**: "You're making great progress! Upgrade to Pro for personalized tutoring"
- **Contextual**: Based on specific limitations encountered

## üìä Revenue Impact Analysis

### Positive Revenue Drivers
1. **Clear Value Proposition**: Users experience the value of live classes
2. **Friction-Free Trial**: Easy to try without commitment
3. **Contextual Upselling**: Prompts appear when users hit limitations
4. **Feature Differentiation**: Clear benefits of each tier

### Risk Mitigation

2. **Quality Control**: Large groups maintain session quality
3. **Conversion Focus**: Aggressive upselling after positive experience

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
