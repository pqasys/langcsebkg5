## Manual Testing Steps

### 1. **Frontend Testing** (Browser-based)

#### Step 1: Access Student Dashboard
1. Open browser and go to `http://localhost:3001`
2. Login as a student user
3. Navigate to the student dashboard
4. Look for the subscription card/component

#### Step 2: Test Subscription Display
- [ ] Verify current subscription status is displayed
- [ ] Check that plan type (BASIC/PREMIUM/PRO) is shown correctly
- [ ] Verify billing cycle (MONTHLY/ANNUAL) is displayed
- [ ] Check that features are listed properly
- [ ] Verify billing history is accessible

#### Step 3: Test Subscription Actions
- [ ] **Upgrade Test**: Try upgrading from BASIC to PREMIUM
- [ ] **Downgrade Test**: Try downgrading from PRO to PREMIUM
- [ ] **Cancel Test**: Test subscription cancellation
- [ ] **Reactivate Test**: Test subscription reactivation

### 2. **API Testing** (With Authentication)

#### Step 1: Get Authentication Token
1. Login through the frontend
2. Open browser DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
3. Look for authentication cookies/session

#### Step 2: Test API Endpoints
```bash
# Test GET endpoint (with auth)
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/student/subscription \
  -H "Cookie: your-auth-cookie" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"

# Test POST endpoint (create subscription)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/student/subscription \
  -H "Cookie: your-auth-cookie" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "planType": "BASIC",
    "billingCycle": "MONTHLY",
    "startTrial": false
  }'

# Test PUT endpoint (upgrade)
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3001/api/student/subscription \
  -H "Cookie: your-auth-cookie" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "action": "UPGRADE",
    "planType": "PREMIUM",
    "billingCycle": "MONTHLY"
  }'

# Test DELETE endpoint (cancel)
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3001/api/student/subscription \
  -H "Cookie: your-auth-cookie" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### 3. **Database Verification Tests**

#### Step 1: Check Subscription Creation
```sql
-- After creating a subscription, verify:
SELECT 
  ss.id,
  ss.studentId,
  ss.status,
  st.planType,
  st.billingCycle,
  st.price,
  st.currency
FROM student_subscriptions ss
JOIN student_tiers st ON ss.studentTierId = st.id
WHERE ss.studentId = 'your-student-id';
```

#### Step 2: Check Billing History
```sql
-- Verify billing history was created:
SELECT 
  sbh.id,
  sbh.billingDate,
  sbh.amount,
  sbh.currency,
  sbh.status,
  sbh.description
FROM student_billing_history sbh
WHERE sbh.subscriptionId = 'subscription-id';
```

#### Step 3: Check Subscription Logs
```sql
-- Verify action was logged:
SELECT 
  sl.action,
  sl.oldPlan,
  sl.newPlan,
  sl.oldAmount,
  sl.newAmount,
  sl.reason,
  sl.createdAt
FROM subscription_logs sl
WHERE sl.subscriptionId = 'subscription-id'
ORDER BY sl.createdAt DESC;
```

## Expected Test Results

### ‚úÖ Successful Test Outcomes

1. **Subscription Creation**
   - API returns 200 with subscription details
   - Database shows new subscription record
   - Billing history entry created
   - Subscription log entry created
   - Frontend shows updated subscription status

2. **Subscription Upgrade**
   - API returns 200 with updated subscription
   - Database shows new tier relationship
   - Billing history updated
   - Log shows upgrade action
   - Frontend reflects new plan features

3. **Subscription Cancellation**
   - API returns 200 with cancellation details
   - Database shows status as 'CANCELLED'
   - Log shows cancellation reason
   - Frontend shows cancelled status

### ‚ùå Common Issues to Watch For

1. **Authentication Errors**
   - 401 Unauthorized: Check session/cookies
   - 403 Forbidden: Check user role

2. **Validation Errors**
   - 400 Bad Request: Check request body format
   - Invalid plan type: Ensure planType is BASIC/PREMIUM/PRO
   - Invalid billing cycle: Ensure billingCycle is MONTHLY/ANNUAL

3. **Database Errors**
   - Foreign key constraint failures
   - Missing StudentTier records
   - Duplicate subscription attempts

## Performance Testing

### Load Testing
```bash
# Test API response times
ab -n 100 -c 10 http://localhost:3001/api/student/subscription
```

### Memory Usage
- Monitor Node.js memory usage during testing
- Check for memory leaks in subscription operations

## Security Testing

### Input Validation
- [ ] Test with invalid plan types
- [ ] Test with negative amounts
- [ ] Test with malformed JSON
- [ ] Test SQL injection attempts

### Authorization
- [ ] Test with different user roles
- [ ] Test access to other users' subscriptions
- [ ] Test API without authentication

## Browser Testing

### Cross-Browser Compatibility
- [ ] Chrome (latest)
- [ ] Firefox (latest)
- [ ] Safari (latest)
- [ ] Edge (latest)

### Mobile Responsiveness
- [ ] Test on mobile devices
- [ ] Test subscription card layout
- [ ] Test action buttons accessibility

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter any issues during testing:

1. **Document the Issue**
   - Screenshot of the error
   - Browser console logs
   - Network tab details
   - Steps to reproduce

2. **Check Logs**
   - Server logs in terminal
   - Database error logs
   - Browser developer tools

3. **Common Fixes**
   - Clear browser cache
   - Restart development server
   - Check database connections
   - Verify environment variables

## Success Criteria ‚úÖ
