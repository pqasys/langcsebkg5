## Technical Implementation

### File Structure
```
lib/data/spanish-proficiency-questions.ts
```

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface TestQuestion {
  id: string;
  level: string;
  question: string;
  options: string[];
  correctAnswer: string;
  explanation?: string;
  category?: string;
  difficulty?: 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard';
}
```

### Utility Functions
- `getRandomQuestions(count, level?, category?)`: Get random questions with optional filtering
- `getQuestionsByLevel(level)`: Get all questions for a specific CEFR level
- `getQuestionsByCategory(category)`: Get all grammar or vocabulary questions
- `getQuestionsByDifficulty(difficulty)`: Get questions by difficulty level
- `getBalancedQuestionSet(count)`: Get a balanced set of grammar and vocabulary questions

## Integration

### Language Proficiency Service
The Spanish questions are integrated into the existing `LanguageProficiencyService` and can be accessed via:
- Database queries (if questions are stored in database)
- Static file imports (current implementation)
- API endpoints for dynamic question retrieval

### UI Components
The test is integrated into:
- `LanguageProficiencyTestInterface.tsx`
- `EnhancedLanguageProficiencyTestInterface.tsx`

Both components support Spanish language selection and will load the appropriate questions when `language` prop is set to 'es'.

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```typescript
import { getBalancedQuestionSet } from '@/lib/data/spanish-proficiency-questions';

// Get 80 balanced questions (40 grammar + 40 vocabulary)
const questions = getBalancedQuestionSet(80);
```

### Level-Specific Usage
```typescript
import { getQuestionsByLevel } from '@/lib/data/spanish-proficiency-questions';

// Get all A1 level questions
const a1Questions = getQuestionsByLevel('A1');

// Get all C2 level questions
const c2Questions = getQuestionsByLevel('C2');
```

### Category-Specific Usage
```typescript
import { getQuestionsByCategory } from '@/lib/data/spanish-proficiency-questions';

// Get all grammar questions
const grammarQuestions = getQuestionsByCategory('grammar');

// Get all vocabulary questions
const vocabularyQuestions = getQuestionsByCategory('vocabulary');
```

## Question Content

### Current Status
The test currently contains placeholder questions with the correct structure and distribution. Each question includes:
- Unique ID following the pattern `{LEVEL}-{CATEGORY}-{NUMBER}`
- Level-appropriate difficulty
- Four multiple-choice options
- Correct answer
- Explanation field (ready for detailed explanations)
- Category classification (grammar/vocabulary)

### Enhancement Opportunities
1. **Content Development**: Replace placeholder questions with authentic Spanish grammar and vocabulary questions
2. **Detailed Explanations**: Add comprehensive explanations for each correct answer
3. **Contextual Questions**: Include questions with real-world scenarios
4. **Regional Variations**: Consider adding questions that cover different Spanish-speaking regions
5. **Audio Integration**: Add pronunciation questions for vocabulary sections
